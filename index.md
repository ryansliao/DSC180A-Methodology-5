1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
    - **I definitely found learning about activity-based models for the first time to be the most interesting topic so far. I have always had some general interest and opinions about city layouts or the reasonings behind it, so it was really nice to get to understand what really goes towards making decisions through the lens of where people choose to spend their time.**
1. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
    - **Since are project is over activity-based models, I would like to either improve upon another existing aspect of the existing ActivitySim model, or create a new part of the model which would be taken into account.**
1. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
    - **We have been focusing on using a multinomial logistic regression model for our vehicle type choice model because it was what was recommended by our mentor and what is used throughout the industry as standard. However, we may decide to go towards a different model which would better deal with our specific unbalanced data. It is also worth noting that the industry standard is to utilize statistical models rather than machine learning for this.**
1. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
    - **We have not really touched on how multiple areas of the AcitivitySim model work together to create the larger general model. I would like to see how different models work together and how to tune a model specifically for the area you are trying to run for.**
